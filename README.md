# MailOrderBro
Create a bro, add a message, and email it as an e-card

The barebones concept of this exists at https://www.mailorderbro.com/
It's just a shitty Google Sites page. We should actually make it tho.

Help make this a reality so that we can easily add more bro clothes, and tons of wonderful features.
Submit a PR, I'll deal with the building/deploying/hosting and infra aspects. If this ends up being so robust that we need 20 Redshift clusters, so be it.
